# Malware-Detection-based-on-Network-Packet-Analysis-with-Federated-Learning
## Introduction
2023 Master Degree Machine Learning Course Homework 6 Practice.

In this project, I explore the integration of machine learning with Federated Learning, further enhanced by the application of Differential Privacy to strengthen user privacy protection.

Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving technique that distributes the machine learning model across different client devices. Instead of centralizing user data, clients train the model locally and upload the updated model parameters to a central server, where they are aggregated to improve the global model. This approach effectively protects user privacy by avoiding data centralization.

To further enhance privacy, I apply Differential Privacy, which adds random noise to the uploaded model parameters. This prevents adversaries from reverse-engineering the original data. The level of noise is adjusted based on different scenarios to strike a balance between privacy protection and model performance.

## Result
Noise = 0.01
